Found this, haven't gotten a chance to try all of it yet. 
Think it might be a good resource on getting started
[Getting Started with Helm Guide](https://linuxhint.com/getting-started-kubernetes-helm-charts/)

Worth taking a look at [Kubernetes-sigs/yaml](https://github.com/kubernetes-sig/yaml) for the parsing the YAML files.
