### Plans for Coming Week
---
- [] Have client test MVP and provide feedback
- [] Figure out if the values must be saved to `values.yaml` or if they can be defined where they are used in the charts. If the latter is true, we will need to find a way to check all of the possible places they can be
- [] Find a way to parse the values from any sub-charts
- [] Figure out how templates play into this. Do we rerun the check on the templates? Do we have a list of allowed templates? How should go about dealing with them in a way that allows maximum flexibility to the end-user?
- [] Explore how we can utilize templates
- [] Parse a `policy.yaml` file and store the values
- [] Write methods to check the values from the policy against the chart
- [] Alert on any misconfigurations
- [] Figure out what to put in the policy files
- [] Figure out where users on the pods are defined

### Tasks 

- Alex  
- John Continue to work on finalizing our mvp with the structure. Also start implementing colors in our terminal for output.
- Jacob Keep updated regarding future schedule changes. Get potential beta version ready to show with above plans finished.
- Sean Continue pair programming with team members to ensure we are following best practices, and making it easier to work as a team. Additionally, drive development to ensure we have MVP delivered for client to test.
- Daniel will continue to stay up-to-date on changes in 492's schedule due to circumstances and keep the team aware of them as well.  In addition, will also modify the verification code to work as the rest of the project is produced, and work towards the final presentation and poster.
