##### Week 3 Accomplishments

Team: 

In coming up with the project, we researched what tech is already out there <br>
> Found `scout2` and `cfn_check` <br>
- We decided to take a second look and see if there were any related implementations that we could use for a guide. 
> We only found AquaSecurity, which a bit out of scope of what we need/of what is useful.
Because the project is open source we could possibly integrate it as a plugin after the project is done with in terms of Senior Design. 


- Continuing  the meetings every week after class to discuss any possible issues
- Met with Julie and came up with a deadline for the minimum deliverables
- Team brainstormed possible methods for developing GUI
    > Came up with the idea to use a local server like `Jupyter Lab does` <br>
- Stevenson met with Workiva advisor, outlined the idea for GUI, explained thought process and why
    > Eric thought it was a good idea and readily agreed to it.

This next week our goal is to discuss different data structures for our project. Also our goal is to keep up the constant researching and experimenting with the languages that we are using
