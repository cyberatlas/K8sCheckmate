##### Week 4 Accomplishments

Team: 

Spent time researching data structures in Golang, looking at implementations, and figuring out which would be the best for our needs and which would be the most efficient
Created doc to track licensing and notes

- Team discussed possible data structures to use to hold values
- Stevenson worked with some people at Workiva about issues that were occurring with the creation of said data structures
> Coworkers clarified the confusion and the issues got resolved.

- Started tracking licensing of resources used in the project. 
> This is to make it easier for Workiva to legally comply with the different terms of the open source licenses that are used in different libraries pulled into the project. 

This next week our goal is to start setting up minikube and working with Helm charts. Also start working with parsing.
