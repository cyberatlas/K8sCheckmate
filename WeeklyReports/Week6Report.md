#####Week 6 Accomplishments

Team: 

> This week we worked further on our proof of concept, making sure to be confident in many of our lower level decisions because the proof of concept will likely be adapted into our full project. Also because this is going to be the core of the project it should be well designed. We also learned more about some of the issues that we would face during the project and talked to Julie as well as Eric about the assignments and about some project issues that we are facing as well as inquiring about a change of language incase we run into some issues. Eric provided a lot of insight that could be used for some of our current hangups.
