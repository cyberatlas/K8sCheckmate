##### Week 6 Accomplishments


- This week we worked further on our proof of concept. 
 > Making sure to be confident in many of our lower level decisions because the proof of concept will likely be adapted into our full project. 
 Also because this is going to be the core of the project it should be well designed. 
 - Learned more about some of the issues that we will be facing during the project 
 - Talked to Julie as well as Eric about the assignments and about some project issues that we are facing and inquired about a change of language should it be needed. 
 - Eric provided a lot of insight that could be used for some of our current hangups. 
 > Including a possible alternative to parsing the Helm files should it become unfeasible to continue in that manner.
- Prepared for presentation. 
- Continued working on Design Doc
