#####Week 2 Accomplishments

Team: 

> This week we worked as a team to round off our understanding and review our research that we have been doing in order to familiarize ourselves with the project tools. The following list is of examples that we have spent time understanding better: 
>
> - Go
>   - example experiments
>   - practicing/understanding language
> - Kubernetes
>   - config files understanding 
> - Helm 
>   - Better understood the relationship
>
> Regarding the work done for the project, our team is still working on getting an adequate understanding of the tools , so that we do not need to start over after realizing any poor architecture decisions.
