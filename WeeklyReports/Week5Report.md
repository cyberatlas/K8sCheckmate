##### Week 5 Accomplishments

Team: 

- Team did a planning meeting to get on the same page and reorganize tasks
- A few members set up Minikube and Helm to play with the charts 
- Doing a lot of research on how Helm charts work and formatted
- Looked at though some of the Helm source code - complex, not exactly intuitive
- YAML parsing was difficult, switched the parser to use the lib created by Kubernetes-sig
- Created a program that parses the Helm `hello-world` charts and extracts some of the data from it still needs work done on it

This next week our goal is to start setting up minikube and working with Helm charts. Also start working with parsing.
