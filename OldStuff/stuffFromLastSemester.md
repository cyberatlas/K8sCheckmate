# Stuff We have Done (for Weekly Reports)

- In coming up with the project, we researched what tech is already out there
    > Found `scout2` and `cfn_check` <br>
    > Outlined in the proposal doc

- Meetings every week after class to discuss any possible issues
- Use groupchat for any questions and constant communication
- Met with Julie and came up with a deadline for the minimum deliverables
- Team brainstormed possible methods for developing GUI
    > Came up with the idea to use a local server like `Jupyter Lab does` <br>
- Stevenson met with Workiva advisor, outlined the idea for GUI, explained thought process and why
    > Eric thought it was a good idea and readily agreed to it. 

**This was week of Halloween**

- Team discussed possible data structures to use to hold values 
- Stevenson worked with some people at Workiva about issues that were occurring with the creation of said data structures
    > Issue got resolved
- Spent time researching data structures in Golang, looking at implementations, and figuring out which would be the best for our needs and which would be the most efficient
- Created doc to track licensing and notes

**This was week of Nov 3**
---
- Team did a planning meeting to get on the same page and reorganize tasks
- A few members set up Minikube and Helm to play with the charts 
- Doing a lot of research on how Helm charts work and formatted
- Looked at though some of the Helm source code - complex, not exactly intuitive
- YAML parsing was difficult, switched the parser to use the lib created by Kubernetes-sig
- Created a program that parses the Helm `hello-world` charts and extracts some of the data from it still needs work done on it

## TODO add anything else you can think of
